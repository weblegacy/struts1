<project name="taskdef">
    <description>
        This project provides following elements to use in your test scripts:

        (0) all webtest's steps loaded and ready to use,
        (1) the path "webtest.path.id" that includes all of webtest's
        libraries,
        (2) the class loader "webtest.loader" that is the original loader for
        webtest.

        Usage:
        Set the property webtest.home to the directory in which the build.zip
        is extracted,
        and calls:
        &lt;import file="${webtest.home}/lib/taskdef.xml" &gt;
    </description>

    <import file="${webtest.home}/lib/classpath.xml"/>

    <taskdef resource="webtest.taskdef"
             loaderref="webtest.loader"
             classpathref="webtest.path.id"
            />
</project>
