            <p>
                Several example applications come bundled with the Struts
                distribution, ready to deploy on your container.
                In the case of Tomcat, you would copy the application's
                WAR file from the <code>apps</code> distribution to
                Tomcat's <code>webapps</code> folder.
             </p>

             <p>As a convenience, the linked examples are available online
             at <a href="http://planetstruts.org">Planet Struts</a>.</p>
