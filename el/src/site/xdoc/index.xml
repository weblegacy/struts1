        <section name="Welcome to Struts EL" id="welcome">

            <p>
                Struts EL is an extension of the Struts Taglib component
                that uses JSTL (the JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library)
                as a foundation technology.
                Each JSP custom tag in this library is a JSTL-aware
                subclass of a corresponding tag in Struts Taglib.
                Since JSTL is a prerequisite,
                only those tags without a JSTL corrollary were ported to
                Struts EL.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since this component utilizes JSTL, the JSTL expression
                language ("EL"), and Struts Taglib, an understanding of all
                three is a prerequisite.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section name="Evaluating Expressions">
            <p>
                Unlike the Struts Taglib component,
                Struts EL does not use runtime scriptlet expressions ("rtexprvalues"),
                EL uses the expression evaluation engine in the Jakarta Taglibs
                implementation of JSTL (version 1.0) to evaluate attribute
                values.
            </p>

            <p>
                The base Struts Taglib contains tags which rely on the
                evaluation of "rtexprvalue"s to render dynamic
                attribute values. For instance, to print a message from a
                properties
                file based on a resource key, you would use the
                <code>bean:write</code>
                tag, perhaps like this:
            </p>
            <source>
                <![CDATA[<bean:message key='<%= stringvar %>'/>]]>
            </source>

            <p>
                This assumes that
                <code>stringvar</code>
                exists as a JSP scripting
                variable. If you're using the
                <strong>Struts-EL</strong>
                library, the
                reference looks very similar, but slightly different, like
                this:
            </p>
            <source>
                <![CDATA[<bean-el:message key="${stringvar}"/>]]>
            </source>
        </section>

        <section name="Tag Mapping">
            <p>
                In implementing the Struts-EL library, every Struts tag that
                provides a feature
                that is not covered by the JSTL (1.0) library is mapped into
                the Struts-EL
                library. This section reviews which Struts tags are NOT
                implemented in the
                Struts-EL library, and which JSTL tags provide that feature.
                (See the <a href="tagreference.html">
                reference</a> for the tags that are implemented.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the non-porting decisions were based on the fact that
                the JSTL
                expression language itself provides the same functionality. In
                those cases, in
                addition to a possible JSTL tag name, the symbol "EL" will be
                listed.
            </p>

                    (Note that the "iterate" tag was originally ported, even
                    with the presence of
                    the "c:forEach" tag, as the "indexed tag" functionality
                    was not supported when
                    using "c:forEach" instead of "logic:iterate". This has
                    since been rectified,
                    such that the "indexed tag" functionality checks for being
                    contained in a
                    "c:forEach" tag, in addition to the "logic:iterate" tag.
                    However, the ported
                    "iterate" tag has not been removed from Struts-EL, for
                    backward compatibility.)

                At this point of the implementation, there is only one change
                (to two similar
                tags) to the set of attributes between the Struts tags, and
                the Struts-EL tags.
                The "logic:match" and "logic:notMatch" tags have an additional
                attribute named
                "expr", which can take any value, and will be used as the
                value to compare
                against, in addition to the choices of "cookie", "header",
                "name"/"property",
                and "parameter".

        <section name="Usage Requirements">
            <p>
                The Struts-EL tag library requires the use of the Struts tag
                library, and the
                Java Server Pages Standard Tag Library. It is not necessary
                for JSP pages
                using the Struts-EL tag library to also use the Struts tags or
                the JSTL tags,
                but the Struts and JSTL tag libraries need to be part of the
                application
                utilizing the Struts-EL tag library.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is because the Struts-EL tag classes are all subclasses
                of Struts tag
                classes, and their implementation uses classes provided by the
                JSTL.
