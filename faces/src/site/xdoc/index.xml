    <section name="Welcome to Struts Faces" id="welcome">

  <p>
    The "Struts Faces" component contains an add-on library that supports
    the use of JavaServer Faces (JSF) user interface technology in a
    Struts-based web application, in place of the Struts custom tag libraries.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Struts-Faces Integration Library should work with any implementation
    of JavaServer Faces, version 1.0 or later.  It has primarily been tested
    against version 1.1 of the
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/">JavaServer Faces</a>
    reference implementation.
  </p>

  <p>
    For more information, consult the
    <a href="README.txt" target="_blank">README</a> file or the
    <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/struts/StrutsFaces">StrutsFaces</a>
    wiki page.
  </p>

  <p>
    Known issues with some JSF implementations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYFACES-1421">
    [MYFACES-1421]</a> - MyFaces 1.1.4 does not recognize the family of the
    Struts Faces form component.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Note that the Struts Faces component is intended as a "bridge" between
    Struts 1 and JavaServer Faces.
    The typical use case is a team that would like to experiment with JSF
    components but does not want to completely rework an existing application.
  </p>

  <p>
    For better JavaServer Faces support,
    consider using Struts 2 or
    <a href="http://shale.apache.org/">Apache Shale.</a>
