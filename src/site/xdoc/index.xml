            <p>
                Struts is a flexible control layer based on
                <a href="userGuide/preface.html">standard technologies</a>
                like Java
                Servlets, JavaBeans, ResourceBundles, and XML, as well as
                various
                <a href="http://commons.apache.org/index.html">Apache
                    Commons</a>
                packages, like BeanUtils and Chain of Responsibility.
                The framework helps you create an extensible
                development
                environment for your application,
                based on published standards and proven design patterns.
            </p>

            <subsection name="Struts in a Nutshell" id="nutshell">

                <p>
                    The framework provides its own web
                    <strong>Controller</strong>
                    component and
                    integrates with other technologies to provide the Model
                    and the View.
                    For the
                    <strong>Model,</strong>
                    the framework can interact
                    with standard data access technologies,
                    like
                    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc/">JDBC</a>
                    and
                    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/">EJB,</a>
                    as well as most any third-party packages,
                    like
                    <a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate,</a>
                    <a href="http://ibatis.apache.org/">iBATIS,</a>
                    or
                    <a href="http://db.apache.org/ojb/">Object Relational
                        Bridge.</a>
                    For the
                    <strong>View,</strong>
                    the framework works well with
                    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">JavaServer
                        Pages,</a>
                    including
                    <a href="struts-el/index.html">JSTL</a> and
                    <a href="struts-faces/index.html">JSF,</a>
                    as well as
                    <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/tools/struts/">
                        Velocity Templates,</a>
                    <a href="http://stxx.sourceforge.net/">XSLT,</a>
                    and other presentation systems.
                </p>

               <p>
                    The framework's Controller acts as a bridge between the
                    application's
                    Model and the web View. When a request is received, the
                    Controller invokes
                    an
                    <strong>Action</strong>
                    class. The Action class consults with the Model
                    (or, preferably, a
                    <strong>Facade</strong>
                    representing your Model)
                    to examine or update the application's state.
                    The framework provides an
                    <strong>ActionForm</strong>
                    class to help transfer
                    data between Model and View.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most often, the Model is represented as a set of
                    <strong>JavaBeans.</strong>
                    Typically, developers will use the Commons
                    <strong>BeanUtils</strong>
                    to
                    transfer data between ActionForms and the Model objects
                    (or a Facade).
                    Preferably, the Model will do the "heavy lifting",
                    and the Action will act as a "traffic cop" or adapter.

                <p>
                    A web application
                    uses a deployment descriptor to initialize resources
                    like
                    <a href="userGuide/preface.html#servlets">servlets</a>
                    and
                    <a href="userGuide/preface.html#jsp">taglibs.</a>
                    The deployment descriptor is formatted as a
                    <a href="userGuide/preface.html#xml">XML</a>
                    document
                    and named "web.xml".
                    Likewise,
                    the framework uses a configuration file to initialize its
                    own resources.
                    These resources include
                    <a href="userGuide/building_controller.html#action_form_classes">
                        ActionForms</a>
                    to collect input from users,

                        ActionMappings</a>
                    to direct input to server-side

                        Actions,</a>
                    and ActionForwards to select output pages.

                <p>
                    Here's a simple configuration (struts-config.xml) for a

                <p>
                    There are several other resources you can specify in the
                    framework's
                    configuration file.
                    You can specify validations for the ActionForms in an XML
                    descriptor,
                    using the
                    <a href="faqs/validator.html">
                    Struts Validator</a>. A standard extension,
                    <a href="https://weblegacy.github.io/struts1/struts-tiles/index.html">
                    Tiles</a>, helps you build pages from smaller fragments.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Struts is extensible.
                    Every class deployed by the framework can be replaced by
                    your own default class.
                    The properties of your default class can be set using the
                    <a href="http://commons.apache.org/digester/">
                        Digester's</a>
                    <code>set-property</code>
                    feature.
                    This is one reason why there are so many

                        contributor
                        extensions.</a>
                    We provide the base framework, but you can still write
                    <b>your</b>
                    application
                    <b>your</b>
                    way.
                </p>

                <p>

                    technologies, see the

            <subsection
                    name="Is Struts the best choice for every project?">

                <p>
                    No. If you need to write a very simple application, with a
                    handful of
                    pages,
                    then you might consider a "Model 1" solution that uses
                    only server
                    pages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But, if you are writing a more complicated application,
                    with dozens of pages,
                    that need to be maintained over time, then Struts
                    can help.
                    For more about whether Model 1 or MVC/Model 2 is right for
                    you, see
