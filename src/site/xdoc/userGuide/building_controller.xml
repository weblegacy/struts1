                <p>
                    Now that we understand how to construct the
                    <a href="building_model.html">Model</a>
                    and
                    <a href="building_view.html">View</a>
                    components
                    of your application, it is time to focus on the Controller
                    components.
                    The framework includes a servlet that implements the
                    primary function of
                    mapping a request URI to an Action class.
                    Therefore, your primary responsibilities related to the
                    Controller are:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        Write an ActionForm class to mediate between the Model
                        and the View.
                        <a href="../faqs/actionForm.html">(See also
                Building an ActionForm.)</a>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Write an Action class for each logical request that
                        may
                        be received (extend the
                        <code>[org.apache.struts.action.Action]</code>
                        class).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Configure a ActionMapping (in XML) for each logical
                        request that may
                        be submitted.
                        The XML configuration file is usually named
                        struts-config.xml.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    To deploy your application, you will also need to:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        Update the web application deployment descriptor file
                        (in XML)
                        for your application to reference the additional
                        components.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Include the additional components with your
                        application.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    For those of you familiar with MVC architecture, the
                    ActionServlet
                    represents the C - the controller.
                    The job of the controller is to:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        process user requests,
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        determine what the user is trying to achieve according
                        to the request,
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        pull data from the model (if necessary) to be given to
                        the appropriate
                        view, and
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        select the proper view to respond to the user.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    Our controller delegates most of this grunt work to the
                    <a href="#request_processor">Request Processor</a>
                    and Action classes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to being the front controller for your
                    application, the
                    ActionServlet instance also is responsible for
                    initialization and
                    clean-up of resources.
                    When the controller initializes, it first loads the
                    application config
                    corresponding to the "config" init-param.
                    It then goes through an enumeration of all init-param
                    elements, looking for those elements who's name starts
                    with
                    config/.
                    For each of these elements, the framework loads the
                    configuration file specified
                    by the value of that init-param, and assigns a "prefix"
                    value to that module's ModuleConfig instance consisting of
                    the piece
                    of the init-param name following "config/".
                    For example, the module prefix specified by the
                    init-param config/foo would be "foo".
                    This is important to know, since this is how the
                    controller determines
                    which module will be given control of processing the
                    request.
                    To access the module foo, you would use a URL like:
                </p>

                <pre>http://localhost:8080/myApp/foo/someAction.do</pre>

                <p>
                    For each request made of the controller, the method
                    process(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) will be
                    called.
                    This method simply determines which module should service
                    the request and
                    then invokes that module's RequestProcessor's process
                    method, passing the
                    same request and response.
                </p>

            <subsection name="4.2.1 Request Processor" id="request_processor">

                <p>
                    The RequestProcessor is where the majority of the core
                    processing
                    occurs for each request. Since version 1.3, the default
                    Request Processor
                    <code>(ComposableRequestProcessor)</code>
                    is composed using
                    <a href="http://commons.apache.org/chain/">
                        Commons Chain,</a>
                    which is an implementation of the
                    <i>Chain of Responsibility</i>
                    pattern (CoR).
                    It is designed as a drop-in replacement of the Struts
                    1.2.x behaviour and brings
                    greater flexibility and easier customization to the
                    request processing process.
                    Each step of the processing is represented as a separate
                    Command in the Chain.
                    By inserting, substituting, or removing Commands,
                    you can customize the framework to work
                    <i>your</i>
                    way.
                    Let's take a look at the
                    <i>default</i>
                    commands for the ComposableRequestProcessor
                    Chain in turn. These Command classes are in either the
                    <code>org.apache.struts.chain.commands</code>
                    or
                    <code>org.apache.struts.chain.commands.servlet</code>

            <subsection name="4.3 ActionForm Classes" id="action_form_classes">

                <p>
                    An ActionForm represents an HTML form that the user
                    interacts with over
                    one or more pages.
                    You will provide properties to hold the state of the form
                    with getters
                    and setters to access them.
                    ActionForms can be stored in either the session (default)
                    or request
                    scope.
                    If they're in the session it's important to implement the
                    form's
                    reset method to initialize the form before each use.
                    The framework sets the ActionForm's properties from the
                    request parameters and
                    sends the validated form to the appropriate Action's
                    execute
                    method.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you code your ActionForm beans, keep the following
                    principles in mind:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        The ActionForm class itself requires no specific
                        methods to be implemented.
                        It is used to identify the role these particular beans
                        play in the overall
                        architecture.
                        Typically, an ActionForm bean will have only property
                        getter
                        and property setter methods, with no business logic.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The ActionForm object also offers a standard
                        validation mechanism.
                        If you override a "stub" method, and provide error
                        messages in the
                        standard application resource, The framework will
                        automatically validate the
                        input from the form (using your method).
                        See
                        <a href="building_view.html#form_validation">
                            Automatic Form
                            Validation</a>
                        for details. Of course, you can also ignore the
                        ActionForm validation and provide your own in the
                        Action object.

                        Define a property (with associated getXxx and
                        setXxx methods) for each field that is present in the
                        form.
                        The field name and property name must match according
                        to the usual
                        JavaBeans conventions (see the Javadoc for the
                        java.beans.Introspector class for a start on
                        information
                        about this).
                        For example, an input field named username will cause
                        the
                        setUsername method to be called.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Buttons and other controls on your form can also be
                        defined as properties.
                        This can help determine which button or control was
                        selected when the
                        form was submitted.
                        Remember, the ActionForm is meant to represent your
                        data-entry form, not
                        just the data beans.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Think of your ActionForm beans as a firewall between
                        HTTP and the Action.
                        Use the validate method to ensure all required
                        properties
                        are present, and that they contain reasonable values.
                        An ActionForm that fails validation will not even be
                        presented to the
                        Action for handling.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        You may also place a bean instance on your form, and
                        use nested property
                        references.
                        For example, you might have a "customer" bean on your
                        ActionForm, and
                        then refer to the property "customer.name" in your
                        presentation page.
                        This would correspond to the methods
                        customer.getName() and
                        customer.setName(String Name) on your customer bean.
                        See the Apache Struts Taglib Developer Guides for more
                        about
                        using the nested syntax.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <em>Caution:</em>
                        If you nest an existing bean instance on your form,
                        think
                        about the properties it exposes.
                        Any public property on an ActionForm that accepts a
                        single String value
                        can be set with a query string.
                        It may be useful to place beans that can affect the
                        business state inside
                        a thin "wrapper" that exposes only the properties
                        required.
                        This wrapper can also provide a filter to be sure
                        runtime properties are
                        not set to inappropriate values.

                <p>
                    Maintaining a separate concrete ActionForm class for each
                    form in your
                    application is time-consuming.
                    It is particularly frustrating when all the ActionForm
                    does is gather
                    and validate simple properties that are passed along to a
                    business
                    JavaBean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This bottleneck can be alleviated through the use of
                    DynaActionForm classes.
                    Instead of creating a new ActionForm subclass and new
                    get/set methods for
                    each of your bean's properties, you can list its
                    properties, type, and
                    defaults in the framework's configuration file.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, add the following to struts-config.xml for a
                    UserForm bean
                    that stores a user's given and family names:
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[
<form-bean
    name="UserForm"
    type="org.apache.struts.action.DynaActionForm">
    <form-property
        name="givenName"
        type="java.lang.String"
        initial="John"/>
    <form-property
        name="familyName"
        type="java.lang.String"
        initial="Smith"/>
</form-bean>
]]></source>

                <p>
                    The types supported by DynaActionForm include:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        java.math.BigDecimal

                    <li>
                        boolean and java.lang.Boolean
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        byte and java.lang.Byte
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        char and java.lang.Character
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        java.lang.Class
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        double and java.lang.Double
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        float and java.lang.Float
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        int and java.lang.Integer
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        long and java.lang.Long
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        short and java.lang.Short
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        java.lang.String
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        java.sql.Date
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        java.sql.Time
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        java.sql.Timestamp
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    You may also specify Arrays of these types (e.g.
                    String[]).
                    You may also specify a concrete implementation of the Map
                    Interface,
                    such as java.util.HashMap,
                    or a List implementation, such as java.util.ArrayList.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you do not supply an initial attribute, numbers will be
                    initialized to
                    0 and objects to null.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In JSP pages using the Struts Taglib, attributes of
                    DynaActionForm objects can be referenced just like
                    ordinary
                    ActionForm objects. Wherever a Struts tag refers to a
                    "property", the tags will automatically use the
                    DynaActionForm properties
                    just like those of a conventional JavaBean.
                    You can even expose DynaActionForm properties using
                    bean:define.
                    (Although, you can't use bean:define to
                    <strong>instantiate</strong>
                    a DynaActionForm,
                    since it needs to be setup with the appropriate
                    dyna-properties).
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you are using the Struts JSTL EL taglib, the references
                    are, by default,
                    different. Only properties of ordinary ActionForm objects
                    can be directly
                    accessed through the JSTL expression language syntax. The
                    DynaActionForm
                    properties must be accessed through a slightly different
                    syntax. The
                    JSTL EL syntax for referencing a property of an ActionForm
                    goes like this:
                </p>

                <source>${formbean.prop}</source>

                <p>
                    The syntax for referencing a property of a DynaActionForm
                    would be:
                </p>

                <source>${dynabean.map.prop}</source>

                <p>
                    The map property is a property of DynaActionForm which
                    represents the
                    HashMap containing the DynaActionForm properties.
                </p>

                <p>
                    DynaActionForms are meant as an easy solution to a common
                    problem:
                    <em>Your ActionForms use simple properties and standard
                        validations,
                        and you just pass these properties over to another
                        JavaBean</em>
                    (say using BeanUtils.copyProperties(myBusinessBean,form)).
                </p>

                <p>
                    DynaActionForms are
                    <strong>not</strong>
                    a drop-in replacement for ActionForms.
                    If you need to access DynaActionForm properties in your
                    Action, you will need to
                    use the map-style accessor, like myForm.get("name").
                    If you actively use the ActionForm object in your Action,
                    then you may want to use conventional ActionForms instead.
                </p>

                <p>
                    DynaActionForms cannot be instantiated using a no-argument
                    constructor.
                    In order to simulate the extra properties,
                    there is a lot of machinery involved in their
                    construction.
                    You must rely on the framework to instantiate a
                    DynaActionForm for you,
                    via the ActionMapping.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If need be, you can extend the DynaActionForm to add
                    custom
                    validate and reset methods you might need.
                    Simply specify your subclass in the struts-config instead.
                    However, you cannot mix conventional properties and
                    DynaProperties.
                    A conventional getter or setter on a DynaActionForm won't
                    be found
                    by the reflection utilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To use DynaActionForms with the Struts Validator, specify
                    org.apache.struts.validator.ValidatorActionForm
                    (or your subclass) as the form-bean class.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And, of course, while the DynaActionForm may support
                    various binary types,
                    properties used with the html:text tag should still be
                    String properties.
                </p>

                <p>
                    DynaActionForms relieve developers of maintaining simple
                    ActionForms. For even
                    less maintenance, try the
                    <a href="#lazy_action_form_classes">LazyActionForm</a>

                <p>
                    Using this
                    <i>lazy</i>
                    ActionForm means that you don't have to define the
                    ActionForm's
                    properties in the struts-config.xml. However, a word of
                    warning, everything in the
                    Request gets populated into this ActionForm circumventing
                    the normal
                    <i>firewall</i>
                    function of Struts forms. Therefore you should only
                    <i>take out</i>
                    of this form properties you expect
                    to be there rather than blindly populating all the
                    properties into the business tier.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Having said that it is not necessary to pre-define
                    properties in the struts-config.xml, it is
                    useful to sometimes do so for
                    <i>mapped</i>
                    or
                    <i>indexed</i>
                    properties. For example, if you want to use
                    a different Map implementation from the default HashMap or
                    an array for indexed
                    properties, rather than the default List type:
                </p>

                <source>
                    &lt;form-bean name="myForm" type="org.apache.struts.validator.LazyValidatorForm"&gt;
                        &lt;form-property name="myMap" type="java.util.TreeMap" /&gt;
                        &lt;form-property name="myBeans" type="org.apache.commons.beanutils.LazyDynaBean[]" /&gt;
                    &lt;/form-bean&gt;
                </source>

                <p>
                    Another reason for defining
                    <i>indexed</i>
                    properties in the struts-config.xml is that
                    if you are validating indexed properties using the
                    Validator and none are submitted then the indexed
                    property will be null which causes validator to fail.
                    Pre-defining them in the
                    struts-config.xml will result in a zero-length indexed
                    property (array or List) being
                    instantiated, avoiding an issue with validator in that
                    circumstance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This implementation validates using the ActionForm
                    <i>name</i>
                    . If you require a version that
                    validates according to the
                    <i>path</i>
                    then it can be easily created in the following manner:
                </p>

                <source>
                    public class MyLazyForm extends LazyValidatorForm {

                        public MyLazyForm () {
                            super();
                            setPathValidation(true);
                        }

                    }
                </source>

                <p>
                    Rather than using this class, another alternative is to
                    either use a LazyDynaBean or
                    custom version of LazyDynaBean directly, the framework now
                    automatically
                    <i>wraps</i>
                    objects
                    which are not ActionForms in a BeanValidatorForm. For
                    example:
                </p>

                <source>
                    &lt;form-bean name="myForm" type="org.apache.commons.beanutils.LazyDynaBean"&gt;
                        &lt;form-property name="myBeans" type="org.apache.commons.beanutils.LazyDynaBean[]" /&gt;
                    &lt;/form-bean&gt;
                </source>

            <subsection name="4.3.3 Map-backed ActionForms" id="map_action_form_classes">

                <p>
                    The DynaActionForm classes offer the ability to create
                    ActionForm beans
                    at initialization time, based on a list of properties
                    enumerated in the
                    the framework's configuration file.
                    However, many HTML forms are generated dynamically at
                    request time.
                    Since the properties of these forms' ActionForm beans are
                    not all known
                    ahead of time, we need a new approach.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The framework allows you to make one or more of your
                    ActionForm's
                    properties' values a Map instead of a traditional atomic
                    object.
                    You can then store the data from your form's dynamic
                    fields in that Map.
                    Here is an example of a map-backed ActionForm class:
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[public FooForm extends ActionForm {

    private final Map values = new HashMap();

    public void setValue(String key, Object value) {
        values.put(key, value);
    }

    public Object getValue(String key) {
        return values.get(key);
    }

}
]]></source>

                <p>
                    In its corresponding JSP page, you can access objects
                    stored in the
                    values map using a special notation: mapname(keyname).
                    The parentheses in the bean property name indicate that:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        The bean property named mapname is indexed using
                        Strings
                        (probably backed by a Map), and that
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The framework should look for get/set methods that
                        take a String key
                        parameter to find the correct sub-property value.
                        The framework will, of course, use the keyname value
                        from the
                        parentheses when it calls the get/set methods.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    Here is a simple example:
                </p>

                <source>
                    <![CDATA[<html:text property="value(foo)"/>]]></source>

                <p>
                    This will call the getValue method on FooForm with a key
                    value of "foo" to find the property value.
                    To create a form with dynamic field names, you could do
                    the following:
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[
<%
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        String name = "value(foo-" + i + ")";
%>
        <html:text property="<%= name %>"/>
        <br/>
<%
    }
%>
]]></source>

                <p>
                    Note that there is nothing special about the name "value".
                    Your map-backed property could instead be named "property",
                    "thingy", or any other bean property name you prefer.
                    You can even have multiple map-backed properties on the
                    same bean.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to map-backed properties, you can also create
                    list-backed
                    properties.
                    You do so by creating indexed get/set methods on your
                    bean:
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[public FooForm extends ActionForm {

    private final List values = new ArrayList();

    public void setValue(int key, Object value) {
        values.set(key, value);
    }

    public Object getValue(int key) {
        return values.get(key);
    }
}
]]></source>

                <p>
                    In your presentation pages, you access individual entries
                    in a list-backed
                    property by using a different special notation:
                    listname[index].
                    The braces in the bean property name indicate that the
                    bean property named
                    listname is indexed (probably backed by a List), and that
                    the framework should look for get/set methods that take an
                    index parameter
                    in order to find the correct sub-property value.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While map-backed ActionForms provide you with more
                    flexibility, they do not support the same range of syntax
                    available to conventional or DynaActionForms.
                    You might have difficulty referencing
                    <a href="../struts-taglib/indexedprops.html">indexed or mapped
                        properties</a>
                    using a map-backed ActionForm.
                    The validwhen validator (since Apache Struts 1.2.1) also
                    does not support map-backed ActionForms.

            <subsection name="4.4 Action Classes" id="action_classes">

                <p>
                    The Action class defines two methods that could be
                    executed depending on your servlet environment:
                </p>

                <source>public ActionForward execute(ActionMapping mapping,
                    ActionForm form,
                    ServletRequest request,
                    ServletResponse response)
                    throws Exception;

public ActionForward execute(ActionMapping mapping,
                    ActionForm form,
                    HttpServletRequest request,
                    HttpServletResponse response)
                    throws Exception;
                </source>

                <p>
                    Since the majority of teams using the framework are
                    focused on building web
                    applications, most projects will only use the
                    "HttpServletRequest"
                    version.
                    A non-HTTP execute() method has been provided for
                    applications that are
                    not specifically geared towards the HTTP protocol.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The goal of an Action class is to process a request, via
                    its execute method, and return an ActionForward
                    object that identifies where control should be forwarded
                    (e.g. a JSP,
                    Tile definition, Velocity template, or another Action) to
                    provide the
                    appropriate response.
                    In the
                    <em>MVC/Model 2</em>
                    design pattern, a typical Action
                    class will often implement logic like the following in its
                    execute method:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        Validate the current state of the user's session (for
                        example,
                        checking that the user has successfully logged on).
                        If the Action class finds that no logon exists, the
                        request can be forwarded to the presentation page that
                        displays the
                        username and password prompts for logging on.
                        This could occur because a user tried to enter an
                        application "in the
                        middle" (say, from a bookmark), or because the session
                        has timed out,
                        and the servlet container created a new one.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If validation is not complete, validate the form bean
                        properties as
                        needed.
                        If a problem is found, store the appropriate error
                        message keys as a
                        request attribute, and forward control back to the
                        input form so that
                        the errors can be corrected.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Perform the processing required to deal with this
                        request (such as
                        saving a row into a database).
                        This
                        <em>can</em>
                        be done by logic code embedded within the
                        Action class itself,
                        <strong>but</strong>
                        should generally be
                        performed by calling an appropriate method of a
                        business logic bean.

                        Update the server-side objects that will be used to
                        create the next
                        page of the user interface (typically request scope or
                        session scope
                        beans, depending on how long you need to keep these
                        items available).

                    <li>
                        Return an appropriate ActionForward object that
                        identifies the presentation page to be used to
                        generate this response,
                        based on the newly updated beans.
                        Typically, you will acquire a reference to such an
                        object by calling
                        findForward on either the ActionMapping
                        object you received (if you are using a logical name
                        local to this
                        mapping), or on the controller servlet itself (if you
                        are using a
                        logical name global to the application).
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    In Apache Struts 1.0, Actions called a perform method
                    instead of
                    the now-preferred execute method.
                    These methods use the same parameters and differ only in
                    which exceptions
                    they throw.
                    The elder perform method throws SerlvetException
                    and IOException.
                    The new execute method simply throws Exception.
                    The change was to facilitate the Declarative Exception
                    handling feature
                    introduced in Apache Struts 1.1.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The perform method may still be used in Apache Struts 1.1
                    but is deprecated.
                    The Apache Struts 1.1 method simply calls the new execute
                    method and wraps any Exception thrown as a
                    ServletException.
                    The deprecated perform method was removed
                    in Apache Struts 1.2.

            <subsection name="4.4.1 Action Class Design Guidelines" id="action_design_guide">

                <p>
                    Remember the following design guidelines when coding
                    Action
                    classes:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Write code for a multi-threaded
                            environment</strong>
                        -
                        Our controller servlet creates
                        <strong>only one instance of your
                            Action class,</strong>
                        and uses this one instance to service
                        all requests.
                        Thus, you need to write thread-safe Action classes.
                        Follow the same guidelines you would use to write
                        thread-safe
                        Servlets.
                        Here are two general guidelines that will help you
                        write scalable,
                        thread-safe Action classes:

                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Only Use Local Variables</strong>
                                - The most important principle
                                that aids in thread-safe coding is to use only
                                local variables,
                                <strong>not instance variables</strong>
                                , in your Action class.
                                Local variables are created on a stack that is
                                assigned (by your
                                JVM) to each request thread, so there is no
                                need to worry about
                                sharing them.
                                An Action can be factored into several local
                                methods,
                                so long as all variables needed are passed as
                                method parameters.
                                This assures thread safety, as the JVM handles
                                such variables
                                internally using the call stack which is
                                associated with a single
                                Thread.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Conserve Resources</strong>
                                - As a general rule, allocating scarce
                                resources and keeping them across requests
                                from the same user
                                (in the user's session) can cause scalability
                                problems.
                                For example, if your application uses JDBC and
                                you allocate a
                                separate JDBC connection for every user, you
                                are probably going
                                to run in some scalability issues when your
                                site suddenly shows
                                up on Slashdot.
                                You should strive to use pools and release
                                resources (such as
                                database connections) prior to forwarding
                                control to the
                                appropriate View component -- even if a bean
                                method you have
                                called throws an exception.
                            </li>

                        </ul>

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Don't throw it, catch it!</strong>
                        - Ever used a commercial website only to
                        have a stack trace or exception thrown in your face
                        after you've already
                        typed in your credit card number and clicked the
                        purchase button?
                        Let's just say it doesn't inspire confidence.
                        Now is your chance to deal with these application
                        errors - in the
                        Action class.
                        If your application specific code throws expections
                        you should catch these
                        exceptions in your Action class, log them in your
                        application's log
                        (servlet.log("Error message", exception)) and return
                        the
                        appropriate ActionForward.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    It is wise to avoid creating lengthy and complex Action
                    classes.
                    If you start to embed too much logic in the Action class
                    itself, you will begin to find the Action class hard to
                    understand, maintain, and impossible to reuse.
                    Rather than creating overly complex Action classes, it is
                    generally a
                    good practice to move most of the persistence, and
                    "business logic" to a
                    separate application layer.
                    When an Action class becomes lengthy and procedural, it
                    may be a good time
                    to refactor your application architecture and move some of
                    this logic
                    to another conceptual layer;
                    otherwise, you may be left with an inflexible application
                    which can only
                    be accessed in a web-application environment.
                    The framework should be viewed as simply the
                    <strong>foundation</strong>
                    for implementing MVC in your applications.
                    Struts provides a useful control layer,
                    but it is not a fully
                    featured platform for building MVC applications, soup to
                    nuts.

            <subsection name="4.5 Exception Handler" id="exception_handler">

                <p>
                    You can define an ExceptionHandler to execute when an
                    Action's
                    execute method throws an Exception.
                    First, you need to subclass
                    org.apache.struts.action.ExceptionHandler and override the
                    execute method.
                    Your execute method should process the Exception and
                    return
                    an ActionForward object to tell the framework where to
                    forward to next.
                    Then you configure your handler in struts-config.xml like
                    this:
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[<global-exceptions>
    <exception
      key="some.key"
      type="java.io.IOException"
      handler="com.yourcorp.ExceptionHandler"/>
</global-exceptions>
]]></source>

                <p>
                    This configuration element says that
                    com.yourcorp.ExceptionHandler.execute will be called when
                    any IOException is thrown by an Action.
                    The key is a key into your message resources properties
                    file
                    that can be used to retrieve an error message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the handler attribute is not specified, the default
                    handler
                    stores the exception in the request attribute under the
                    value of the
                    Globals.EXCEPTION_KEY global key.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The possible attributes for the "exception" element are as
                    follows:
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Attribute</th>

                            associated with this handler. The default
                            attribute is the

                    You can override global exception handlers by defining a
                    handler inside an
                    action definition.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A common use of ExceptionHandlers is to configure one for
                    java.lang.Exception so it's called for any exception and
                    log
                    the exception to some data store.

                    The
                    <em>PlugIn</em>
                    interface extends Action and so that applications can
                    easily hook into the ActionServlet lifecycle.
                    This interface defines two methods, init() and
                    destroy(), which are called at application startup and
                    shutdown, respectively.
                    A common use of a Plugin Action is to configure or load
                    application-specific data as the web application is
                    starting up.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At runtime, any resource setup by init would be accessed
                    by
                    Actions or business tier classes.
                    The PlugIn interface allows you to setup resources, but
                    does not provide
                    any special way to access them.
                    Most often, the resource would be stored in application
                    context, under
                    a known key, where other components can find it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    PlugIns are configured using &lt;plug-in&gt; elements
                    within the
                    framework's configuration file.

            <subsection name="4.7 The ActionMapping Implementation" id="actionmapping">

                <p>
                    In order to operate successfully, our controller servlet
                    needs
                    to know several things about how each request URI should
                    be mapped to an
                    appropriate Action class.
                    The required knowledge has been encapsulated in a Java
                    class named
                    <em>ActionMapping,</em>
                    the most important properties are as follows:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        type - Fully qualified Java class name of the Action
                        implementation class used by this mapping.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        name - The name of the form bean defined in the config
                        file
                        that this action will use.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        path - The request URI path that is matched to select
                        this
                        mapping.
                        See below for examples of how matching works and how
                        to use wildcards
                        to match multiple request URIs.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        unknown - Set to true if this action
                        should be configured as the default for this
                        application, to handle
                        all requests not handled by another action.
                        Only one action can be defined as a default within a
                        single application.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        validate - Set to true if the
                        validate method of the action associated with this
                        mapping
                        should be called.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        forward - The request URI path to which control is
                        passed
                        when this mapping is invoked.
                        This is an alternative to declaring a type property.

            <subsection name="4.8 Writing Action Mappings" id="config">

                <p>
                    How does the controller servlet learn about the mappings
                    you want?
                    It would be possible (but tedious) to write a small Java
                    class that simply
                    instantiated new ActionMapping instances, and called all
                    of
                    the appropriate setter methods.
                    To make this process easier,
                    the framework uses the Commons Digester component
                    to parse an XML-based description of the desired mappings
                    and create the appropriate objects initialized
                    to the appropriate default values.
                    See the
                    <a href="http://commons.apache.org">Apache
                        Commons
                        website</a>
                    for more information about the Digester.

                <p>
                    The developer's responsibility is to create an XML file
                    named
                    struts-config.xml and place it in the WEB-INF directory of
                    your application.

                    This chapter covers the configuration elements that you
                    will typically
                    write as part of developing your application.
                    There are several other elements that can be placed in the
                    struts-config file to customize your application.
                    See

                    The controller uses an internal copy of this document to
                    parse the
                    configuration; an Internet connection is not required for
                    operation.

                    The outermost XML element must be &lt;struts-config&gt;.
                    Inside of the &lt;struts-config&gt; element, there are
                    three important

                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>&lt;form-beans&gt;</strong>
                    <br/>
                    This section contains your form bean definitions.
                    Form beans are descriptors that are used to create
                    ActionForm instances
                    at runtime.
                    You use a &lt;form-bean&gt; element for each form bean,
                    which has the
                    following important attributes:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        name: A unique identifier for this bean, which will be
                        used to reference it in corresponding action mappings.
                        Usually, this is also the name of the request or
                        session attribute
                        under which this form bean will be stored.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        type: The fully-qualified Java classname of the
                        ActionForm subclass to use with this form bean.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>&lt;global-forwards&gt;</strong>
                    <br/>
                    This section contains your global forward definitions.
                    Forwards are instances of the ActionForward class returned
                    from an
                    Action's execute method.
                    These map logical names to specific resources (typically
                    JSPs), allowing
                    you to change the resource without changing references to
                    it throughout
                    your application.
                    You use a &lt;forward&gt; element for each forward
                    definition, which has the following important attributes:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        name: The logical name for this forward.
                        This is used in your Action's execute method to
                        forward to the next appropriate resource.
                        Example: homepage
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        path: The context relative path to the resource.
                        Example: /index.jsp or /index.do
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        redirect: True or false
                        (default).
                        Should the ActionServlet redirect to the resource
                        instead of forward?
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>&lt;action-mappings&gt;</strong>
                    <br/>
                    This section contains your action definitions.
                    You use an &lt;action&gt; element for each of the mappings
                    you would like to define.
                    Most action elements will define at least the following
                    attributes:
                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li>
                        path: The application context-relative path to the
                        action.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        type: The fully qualified java classname of your
                        Action class.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        name: The name of your
                        &lt;form-bean&gt; element to use with this action

                <p>
                    Here's a mapping entry based on the MailReader example
                    application. The MailReader application now uses
                    DynaActionForms.
                    But in this example, we'll show a conventional
                    ActionForm instead, to illustrate the usual workflow.
                    Note that the entries for all the other actions are left
                    out:

                <p>
                    First the form bean is defined.
                    A basic bean of class
                    "org.apache.struts.webapp.example.LogonForm"
                    is mapped to the logical name "logonForm".
                    This name is used as a request attribute name for the form
                    bean.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The "global-forwards" section is used to create logical
                    name
                    mappings for commonly used presentation pages.
                    Each of these forwards is available through a call to your
                    action mapping
                    instance, i.e. mapping.findForward("logicalName").
                </p>

                <p>
                    As you can see, this mapping matches the path /logon
                    (actually, because the MailReader example application uses
                    extension
                    mapping, the request URI you specify in a JSP page would
                    end in
                    /logon.do).
                    When a request that matches this path is received, an
                    instance of the
                    <em>LogonAction</em>
                    class will be created (the first time only) and used.
                    The controller servlet will look for a bean in request
                    scope under key
                    logonForm, creating and saving a bean of the specified
                    class
                    if needed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Optional but very useful are the local "forward" elements.
                    In the MailReader example application, many actions
                    include a local
                    "success" and/or "failure" forward as part of an action
                    mapping.
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[<!-- Edit mail subscription -->
<action
    path="/editSubscription"
    type="org.apache.struts.webapp.example.EditSubscriptionAction"
    name="subscriptionForm"
    scope="request"
    validate="false">
    <forward
        name="failure"
        path="/mainMenu.jsp"/>
    <forward
        name="success"
        path="/subscription.jsp"/>
</action>
]]></source>

                <p>
                    Using just these two extra properties, the Action classes
                    are almost
                    totally independent of the actual names of the
                    presentation pages.
                    The pages can be renamed (for example) during a redesign,
                    with negligible
                    impact on the Action classes themselves.
                    If the names of the "next" pages were hard coded into the
                    Action classes,
                    all of these classes would also need to be modified.
                    Of course, you can define whatever local forward
                    properties
                    makes sense for your own application.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The configuration file includes several other elements
                    that you
                    can use to customize your application.
                    See

            <subsection name="4.9 Using ActionMappings for Pages" id="module_config_use_actions">

                <p>
                    Fronting your pages with ActionMappings is
                    <em>essential</em>
                    when using
                    modules, since doing so is the only way you involve the
                    controller in the request -- and you want to!
                    The controller puts the application configuration in the
                    request,
                    which makes available all of your module-specific
                    configuration data
                    (including which message resources you are using,
                    request-processor,
                    and so forth).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The simplest way to do this is to use the forward property
                    of the ActionMapping:
                </p>

                <pre>&lt;action path="/view" forward="/view.jsp"/></pre>

            <subsection name="4.10 Using Wildcards in ActionMappings" id="action_mapping_wildcards">

                <p>
                    [Since Apache Struts 1.2.0] As an application grows in
                    size,
                    so will the number of action mappings.
                    Wildcards can be used to combine similar mappings
                    into one more generic mapping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best way to explain wildcards is to show an example
                    and walk through
                    how it works. This example modifies the previous mapping
                    in the
                    <a
                            href="#action_mapping_example">ActionMapping
                        Example</a>
                    section to use
                    wildcards to match all pages that start with /edit:
                </p>

                <source><![CDATA[<!-- Generic edit* mapping -->
<action
    path="/edit*"
    type="org.apache.struts.webapp.example.Edit{1}Action"
    name="{1}Form"
    scope="request"
    validate="false">
    <forward
        name="failure"
        path="/mainMenu.jsp"/>
    <forward
        name="success"
        path="/{1}.jsp"/>
</action>
]]></source>

                <p>
                    The "*" in the path attribute allows the mapping to match
                    the
                    request URIs /editSubscription, editRegistration,
                    or any other URI that starts with
                    /edit, however /editSubscription/add would not be
                    matched. The part of
                    the URI matched by the wildcard will then be substituted
                    into various
                    attributes of the action mapping and its action forwards
                    replacing
                    {1}.
                    For the rest of the request, the framework will see the
                    action mapping and its
                    action forwards containing the new values.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mappings are matched against the request in the order they
                    appear in
                    the framework's configuration file. If more than one
                    pattern matches the
                    last one wins, so less specific patterns must appear
                    before more
                    specific ones. However, if the request URL can be matched
                    against
                    a path without any wildcards in it, no wildcard matching
                    is performed
                    and order is not important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wildcard patterns can contain one or more of the following
                    special tokens:
                </p>

                <table>

                        </td>
                        <td>
                            Matches zero or more characters excluding the
                            slash ('/') character.
                        </td>

                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            \character
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            The backslash character is used as an escape
                            sequence. Thus \* matches the character asterisk
                            ('*'), and \\
                            matches the character backslash ('\').
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p>
                    In the action mapping and action forwards, the
                    wildcard-matched values can
                    be accessed with the token {N} where N
                    is a number from 1 to 9 indicating
                    which wildcard-matched value to substitute. The whole
                    request URI can be
                    accessed with the {0} token.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The action mapping attributes that will accept
                    wildcard-matched strings
                    are:
                </p>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    Also, the action mapping properties (set using the &lt;set-property
                    key="foo"
                    value="bar"&gt; syntax) will accept wildcard-matched
                    strings in their
                    value attribute.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The action forward attributes that will accept
                    wildcard-matched strings
                    are:
                </p>

                    <li>path</li>

                <p>
                    Like the action mapping, the action forward properties
                    (set using the
                    &lt;set-property key="foo" value="bar"&gt; syntax) will

                <p>
                    The commons-logging interface is an
                    <em>ultra-thin</em>
                    bridge to many
                    different logging implementations.
                    The intent is to remove compile- and run-time dependencies
                    on any
                    single logging implementation.
                    For more information about the currently-supported
                    implementations,
                    please refer to the
                    <a href="http://commons.apache.org/logging/api/index.html">
                        the description for the org.apache.commons.logging
                        package.</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because the framework uses commons-logging and, therefore,
                    includes the necessary JAR files,
                    you've probably had the occasional fleeting thought,
                    <em>"Should I use commons-logging?"</em>
                    The answer (surprise!) depends on the requirements for
                    your particular
                    project.
                    If one of your requirements is the ability to easily
                    change logging
                    implementations with zero impact on your application, then
                    commons-logging
                    is a very good option.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>"Great! What do I do to get started using
                        commons-logging in my own
                        code?"</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using commons-logging in your own code is very simple -
                    all you need are
                    two imports and a declaration for a logger.
                    Let's take a look:
                </p>

                <source>package com.foo;
                    // ...
                    import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;
                    import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;
                    ...
                    public class Foo {
                    // ...
                    private static Log log = LogFactory.getLog(Foo.class);
                    // ...
                    public void setBar(Bar bar) {
                    if (log.isTraceEnabled()) {
                    log.trace("Setting bar to " + bar);
                    }
                    this.bar = bar;
                    }
                    // ...
                    }
                </source>

                <p>
                    The general idea is to instantiate a single logger per
                    class and to
                    use a name for the logger which reflects where it's being
                    used. The
                    example is constructed with the class itself. This gives
                    the
                    logger the name of com.foo.Foo. Doing things this way lets
                    you
                    easily see where the output is coming from, so you can
                    quickly
                    pin-point problem areas. In addition, you are able to
                    enable/disable
                    logging in a very fine-grained way.
