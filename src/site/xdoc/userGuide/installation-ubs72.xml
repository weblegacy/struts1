                    7.2</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>You need UBS version 7.2 to run war file applications.
                        The UBS 7.2.2 evaluation
                        is located
                        <a href="http://www.bluestone.com/SaISAPI.dll/SaServletEngine.class/products/downloads.jsp">
                            here</a>
                        .
                        If you're using version 7.2.1, you need to download
                        the WAR file patch, located
                        in the product enhancement section of Bluestone's
                        website
                        <a href="http://www.bluestone.com/SaISAPI.dll/SaServletEngine.class/products/wfe.jsp">
                            here</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>After installation of the correct version and/or patch
                        of UBS 7.2, you
                        need to modify your apserver.txt file to point to the
                        correct directory for
                        your war file applications. Look for the section that
                        says something similar
                        to the following:
                        <br/>
                        <pre>
                            [SaServletEngine.class]
                            session_affinity=1
                            type=1
                            program=/SaServletEngine.class
                            file_path=f:\webapps
                            host=localhost:20000
                        </pre>
                    </li>

                    <li>Use the directory specified by the "file_path"
                        variable, or modify it to
                        point to your own custom webapp directory. Copy the
                        "struts-documention.war"
                        and "struts-example.war" files into that webapp
                        directory, and start the UBS
                        (read documentation distributed with UBS for
                        information on how to start it
                        if necessary). Your webapps are now accessible from
                        the following URL:
                        <p class="center">http://localhost/&lt;PLUGIN&gt;/SaServletEngine.class/struts-example/
                            <br/>
                            http://localhost/&lt;PLUGIN&gt;/SaServletEngine.class/struts-documentation/
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>Note: "&lt;PLUGIN&gt;" represents the plugin you are
                        using for your specific
                        webserver. For Apache on Windows, it might be
                        "cgi-bin/SaCGI.exe", for IIS
                        on Windows, it might be "scripts/SaCGI.exe" or
                        "scripts/ISAPI.dll". Consult
                        the UBS documentation for more information.</li>
                </ul>
