                    This User Guide is written for active web developers and
                    assumes a working

                    Before getting started, you should
                    understand the basics of several key technologies:

            <subsection name="0.2 HTTP, HTML and User Agents" id="http">

                <p>The World Wide Web was built over the Hypertext Transfer
                    Protocol
                    <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt?number=2616">
                        (HTTP)</a>
                    and the Hypertext Markup Language
                    <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/">(HTML).</a>
                    A User Agent, like a web browser, uses HTTP to request
                    a HTML document. The browser then formats and displays the
                    document to its user. HTTP is used to
                    transport more than HTML, but HTML is the lingua franca of
                    the Web and web applications.
                </p>

                <p>While building web applications, some Java developers
                    write their own HTML. Others leave that responsibility to
                    the
                    page designers.</p>

            <subsection name="0.3 The HTTP Request/Response cycle" id="cycle">

                <p>A very important part of HTTP for the web developer is the
                    request/response cycle. To use HTTP
                    you have to make a request. A HTTP server, like a web
                    server, is then obliged to respond. When you
                    build your web application, you design it to react to a
                    HTTP request by returning a HTTP response.
                    Frameworks abstract much of these nuts and bolts, but it
                    is important to understand
                    what is happening behind the scenes.</p>

                <p>If you are not familiar with the HTTP request/response
                    cycle, we
                    <strong>strongly</strong>
                    recommend the
                    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/tutorial/1_3-fcs/doc/HTTP.html">
                        HTTP Overview</a>

            <subsection
                    name="0.4 The Java Language and Application Frameworks" id="java">

                <p>The framework is written in the popular and versatile
                    <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/first_edition/html/index.html">
                        Java programming language.</a>
                    Java is an object-orientated language, and the framework
                    makes good use of many
                    object-orientated techniques. In addition, Java natively
                    supports the
                    concept of
                    <em>threads,</em>
                    which allows more than one task to be
                    performed at the same time. A good understanding of Java,
                    and especially
                    object-orientated programming (OOP) and threading, will
                    help
                    you get the most out of the framework and this User Guide.

            <subsection name="0.4.1 Chain of Responsibility" id="chain">

                <p>
                    A popular technique for organizing the execution of
                    complex
                    processing flows is the "Chain of Responsibility" pattern,
                    as described (among many other places) in the classic
                    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201633612/apachesoftwar-20/">
                        "Gang of Four" design patterns book.</a>
                    The GoF summarizes the Chain of Responsibility pattern as
                    "Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver
                    by giving more than one object a chance to handle the
                    request.
                    Chain the receiving objects
                    and pass the request along the chain until an object
                    handles it."
                </p>

                <p>
                    The CoR pattern helps us keep software components loosely
                    coupled.
                    A component can call a Chain of Responsbility,
                    without knowing what objects are on the chain or how they
                    are
                    implemented.
                    Most importantly, we can adjust the Chain without changing
                    how callers invoke the Chain.
                    As of version 1.3,
                    the default Request Processor,
                    which acts as the framework's "kernal",
                    is a Chain of Responsiblity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To implement its Chain, the Request Processor uses the
                    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/chain/">
                        Chain of Responsibility</a>
                    component in the Jakarta Commons
                    which provides a standard implementation of the CoR
                    pattern,
                    along with various implementations of the Context and
                    Command objects used by the Chain to service a request.
                </p>

            <subsection name="0.5 JavaBeans" id="javabeans">

                <p>Like many Java applications, most of the framework objects
                    are designed as
                    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/">
                        JavaBeans.</a>
                    Following the JavaBean design patterns makes
                    the framework's classes easier to use -- both by Java
                    developers and by Java development tools.
                </p>

                <p>Although JavaBeans were first created for visual elements,
                    these object design patterns have been found to
                    be useful as the basis for any reusable component, like
                    those used by the framework.</p>

            <subsection name="0.5.1 Reflection and Introspection" id="reflection">

                <p>
                    Reflection is the process of determining which member
                    fields and methods are available on an object.
                    Introspection is a specialized form of reflection used by
                    the JavaBean API.
                    Using Introspection, we can determine which methods of a
                    JavaBean are intended to be accessed by other objects.
                    (The getters and the setters, for example.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    The framework uses Introspection to convert HTTP
                    parameters into JavaBean properties and to populate HTML
                    fields from JavaBean properties.
                    This technique makes it easy to "roundtrip" properties
                    between HTML forms and JavaBeans.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaBeans store data as properties and may act on that
                    data through other methods.
                    JavaBeans are flexible and powerful objects but are not
                    the only object that programmers use to store data.
                    Another popular object is the Map
                    <code>[java.util.Map].</code>
                    A Map is a simple collection of name and value pairs.
                    Maps are often used "behind the scenes" as a flexible way
                    to store dynamic data.

            </subsection>

            <subsection name="0.5.3 DynaBeans" id="dynabeans">

                <p>
                    DynaBeans combine the extensibility of JavaBeans with the
                    flexibility of a Map.
                    Defining even the simplest JavaBean requires defining a
                    new class and coding a field and two methods for each
                    property.
                    The properties of a DynaBean can be configured via an XML
                    descriptor.
                    The virtual properties of a DynaBean can't be called by
                    standard Java methods,
                    but work well with components that rely on reflection and
                    introspection.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In your application, you can use DynaBeans to describe
                    your HTML forms.
                    This strategy can avoid creating a formal JavaBean
                    subclass to store a few simple properties.

            <subsection name="0.7 Java Servlets" id="servlets">
                <p>
                    Since Java is an object-orientated language, the
                    <a href="http://www.novocode.com/doc/servlet-essentials/">
                        Java Servlet</a>
                    platform strives to cast HTTP into an object-orientated
                    form.
                    This strategy makes it easier for Java developers to
                    concentrate on what they need their application to do --
                    rather than the mechanics of HTTP.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HTTP provides a standard mechanism for extending servers
                    called the Common Gateway Interface, or CGI.
                    The server can pass a request to a CGI-aware program, and
                    the program will pass back a response.
                    Likewise, a Java-aware server can pass a request to a
                    servlet container.
                    The container can fulfill the request or it can pass the
                    request back to the HTTP server.
                    The container decides whether it can handle the request by
                    checking its list of servlets.
                    If there is a servlet registered for the request, the
                    container passes the request to the servlet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When a request comes in, the container checks to see if
                    there is a servlet registered for that request.
                    If there is a match,
                    the request is given to the servlet.
                    If not, the request is returned to the HTTP server.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's the container's job to manages the servlet lifecycle.
                    The container creates the servlets, invokes the servlets,
                    and ultimately disposes the servlets.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A servlet is generally a subclass of
                    <code>jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet.</code>
                    A servlet must implement four methods, which are invoked
                    by the container as needed:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>public void init(ServletConfig
                            config)</strong>
                        - Called by the
                        servlet container when the servlet instance is first
                        created, and
                        before any request is processed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request,
                            HttpServletResponse response)</strong>
                        - Called to process a
                        specific request received using the HTTP
                        <code>GET</code>
                        protocol,
                        which generates a corresponding dynamic response.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request,
                            HttpServletResponse response)</strong>
                        - Called to process a
                        specific request received using the HTTP
                        <code>POST</code>
                        protocol,
                        which generates a corresponding dynamic response.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>public void destroy()</strong>
                        - Called by the servlet
                        container when it takes this servlet instance out of
                        service,
                        such as when a web application is being undeployed or
                        when the
                        entire container is being shut down.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The framework provides a ready-to-use servlet for your
                    application
                    <code>[org.apache.struts.action.ActionServlet].</code>
                    As a developer, you can then just write objects
                    that the ActionServlet calls when needed.
                    But it is still helpful to understand the
                    servlet essentials,
                    and the role they play in a Java web application.

                    To boost performance, the container can multi-thread
                    servlets.
                    Only one instance of a particular servlet is created,
                    and each request for that servlet passes through the same
                    object.
                    This strategy helps the container make the best use of
                    available resources.
                    The tradeoff is that the servlet's
                    <code>doGet()</code>
                    and
                    <code>doPost()</code>
                    methods must be programmed in a
                    <em>thread-safe</em>
                    manner.

                <p>The
                    <em>ServletContext</em>
                    interface
                    <code>[jakarta.servlet.ServletContext]</code>
                    defines a servlet's view of
                    the web application within which the servlet is running.
                    It is
                    accessible in a servlet via the
                    <code>getServletConfig()</code>
                    method,
                    and in a JSP page as the
                    <code>application</code>
                    implicit variable.
                    Servlet contexts provide several APIs that are very useful
                    in building web applications:

                        <em>Access To Web Application Resources</em>
                        - A servlet can
                        access static resource files within the web
                        application using the
                        <code>getResource()</code>
                        and
                        <code>getResourceAsStream()</code>
                        methods.

                    <li>
                        <em>Servlet Context Attributes</em>
                        - The context makes available
                        a storage place for Java objects, identified by
                        string-valued keys.
                        These attributes are global to the entire web
                        application, and may
                        be accessed by a servlet using the
                        <code>getAttribute(),</code>
                        <code>getAttributeNames(),</code>
                        <code>removeAttribute(),</code>
                        and
                        <code>setAttribute()</code>
                        methods. From a JSP page, servlet
                        context attributes are also known as "application
                        scope beans".

            <subsection name="0.7.3 Servlet Request" id="request">

                <p>Each request processed by a servlet is represented by a
                    Java
                    interface, normally a
                    <code>HttpServletRequest</code>
                    <code>[jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest].</code>
                    The request interface provides an object-oriented
                    mechanism to access
                    all of the information that was included in the underlying
                    HTTP request,
                    including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>Cookies</em>
                        - The set of cookies included with this request
                        are available via the
                        <code>getCookies()</code>
                        method.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Headers</em>
                        - HTTP headers that were included with
                        the request are accessible by name. You can enumerate
                        the names
                        of all included headers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Parameters</em>
                        - Request parameters, including those from
                        the query string portion of the URL and from the
                        embedded content
                        of the request (POST only) are available by name.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Request Characteristics</em>
                        - Many other characteristics
                        of the incoming HTTP request, such as the method used
                        (normally
                        GET or POST) the protocol scheme used ("http" or
                        "https"), and
                        similar values.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Request URI Information</em>
                        - The original request URI
                        being processed is available via
                        <code>getRequestURI()</code>
                        .
                        In addition, the constituent parts into which the
                        servlet container
                        parses the request URI (contextPath, servletPath, and
                        pathInfo) are
                        available separately.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>User Information</em>
                        - If you are using
                        <a href="#security">Container Managed Security</a>
                        , you can ask for
                        the username of the authenticated user, retrieve a
                        <code>Principal</code>
                        object representing the current user, and
                        whether the current user is authorized for a specified
                        role.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>In addition, servlet requests support
                    <em>request attributes</em>
                    (from JSP, these are "request scope beans"), analogous to
                    the servlet
                    context attributes described above. Request attributes are
                    often used
                    to communicate state information from a business logic
                    class that
                    generates it to a view component (such as a JSP page) that
                    will use
                    the information to produce the corresponding response.
                </p>

                <p>The servlet container guarantees that a particular request
                    will
                    be processed by a servlet on a single thread. Therefore,
                    you do not
                    generally have to worry about the thread safety of your
                    access to
                    request properties and attributes.</p>

            <subsection name="0.7.4 Servlet Response" id="response">

                <p>The primary purpose of a servlet is to process an incoming
                    <a href="#request">Servlet Request</a>
                    <code>[jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest]</code>
                    and convert it into a
                    corresponding response. This is performed by calling
                    appropriate
                    methods on the servlet response
                    <code>[jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse]</code>
                    interface. Available methods let you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>Set Headers</em>
                        - You can set HTTP headers that will be
                        included in the response. The most important header is
                        the
                        <code>Content-Type</code>
                        header, which tells your client what
                        kind of information is included in the body of this
                        response.
                        This is typically set to
                        <code>text/html</code>
                        for an HTML page,
                        or
                        <code>text/xml</code>
                        for an XML document.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Set Cookies</em>
                        - You can add cookies to the current
                        response.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Send Error Responses</em>
                        - You can send an HTTP error status
                        (instead of a usual page of content) using
                        <code>sendError()</code>
                        .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Redirect To Another Resource</em>
                        - You can use the
                        <code>sendRedirect()</code>
                        method to redirect the client to
                        some other URL that you specify.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>An important principle in using the servlet response APIs
                    is that
                    any methods you call to manipulate headers or cookies
                    <strong>MUST</strong>
                    be performed before the first buffer-full of
                    content has been flushed to the client. The reason for
                    this restriction
                    is that such information is transmitted at the beginning
                    of the HTTP
                    response, so trying things like adding a header after the
                    headers have
                    already been sent will not be effective.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you are using presentation pages in a Model 2
                    application,
                    you will not generally use the servlet response APIs
                    directly.
                    In the case of JavaServerPages, the JSP page compiler
                    in your servlet container will convert your page into a
                    servlet.
                    The JSP servlet renders the response, interspersing
                    dynamic
                    information where you have interposed JSP custom tags.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other presentation systems, like Velocity Tools for
                    Struts,
                    may delegate rendering the response to a specialized
                    servlet,
                    but the same pattern holds true.
                    You create a template,
                    and the dynamic response is generated automatically from
                    the template.
                </p>

                    <strong>2.3</strong>
                    or later of the Servlet Specification (such as
                    Tomcat 4.x), you can take advantage of the new Filter APIs
                    <code>[jakarta.servlet.Filter]</code>
                    that
                    let you compose a set of components that will process a
                    request or
                    response. Filters are aggregated into a chain in which
                    each filter
                    has a chance to process the request and response before
                    and after
                    it is processed by subsequent filters (and the servlet
                    that is ultimately
                    called).
                </p>

                <p>The Struts 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 versions require only version
                    2.2 or later
                    of the Servlet Specification to be implemented by your
                    servlet container,
                    so those versions do not use Filters. Beginning with the
                    1.3 version, a container that supports version 2.3 or
                    later of the Servlet
                    Specification is required, and it is possible that the
                    framework might use
                    Filters in the future.</p>

                <p>

            <subsection name="0.7.6 Sessions" id="session">

                <p>One of the key characteristics of HTTP is that it is
                    <em>stateless.</em>
                    In other words, there is nothing built in to
                    HTTP that identifies a subsequent request from the same
                    user as being
                    related to a previous request from that user. This makes
                    building an
                    application that wants to engage in a conversation with
                    the user over
                    several requests to be somewhat difficult.
                </p>

                <p>To alleviate this difficulty, the servlet API provides a
                    programmatic
                    concept called a
                    <em>session,</em>
                    represented as an object that
                    implements the
                    <code>jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSession</code>
                    interface.
                    The servlet container will use one of two techniques
                    (cookies or
                    URL rewriting) to ensure that the next request from the
                    same user will
                    include the
                    <em>session id</em>
                    for this session, so that state
                    information saved in the session can be associated with
                    multiple
                    requests. This state information is stored in
                    <em>session
                        attributes</em>
                    (in JSP, they are known as "session scope beans").
                </p>

                <p>To avoid occupying resources indefinately when a user fails to
                    complete
                    an interaction, sessions have a configurable
                    <em>timeout interval.</em>
                    If the time gap between two requests exceeds this
                    interval, the session
                    will be timed out, and all session attributes removed. You
                    define a
                    default session timeout in your web application deployment
                    descriptor,
                    and you can dynamically change it for a particular session
                    by calling
                    the
                    <code>setMaxInactiveInterval()</code>
                    method.
                </p>

                <p>Unlike requests, you need to be concerned about thread
                    safety on
                    your session attributes (the methods these beans provide,
                    not the
                    <code>getAttribute()</code>
                    and
                    <code>setAttribute()</code>
                    methods
                    of the session itself). It is surprisingly easy for there
                    to be
                    multiple simultaneous requests from the same user, which
                    will therefore
                    access the same session.
                </p>

                <p>Another important consideration is that session attributes
                    occupy
                    memory in your server
                    <em>in between</em>
                    requests. This can have
                    an impact on the number of simultaneous users that your
                    application can
                    support. If your application requirements include very
                    large numbers of
                    simultaneous users, you will likely want to minimize your
                    use of
                    session attributes, in an effort to control the overall
                    amount of memory
                    required to support your application.
                </p>

            <subsection name="0.7.7 Dispatching Requests" id="dispatch">

                <p>
                    The Java Servlet specification extends the HTTP
                    request/response cycle by allowing the request to be
                    dispatched,
                    or forwarded, between resources.
                    The framework uses this feature to pass a request through
                    specialized components,
                    each handling one aspect of the response.
                    In the normal course, a request may pass through a
                    controller object, a model object,
                    and finally to a view object as part of a single
                    request/response cycle.

                <p>
                    Just as a HTTP server can be used to host several distinct
                    websites,
                    a servlet container can be used to host more than one web
                    application.
                    The Java servlet platform provides a well-defined
                    mechanism for organizing and deploying web applications.
                    Each application runs in its own namespace so that they
                    can be developed and deployed separately.
                    A web application can be assembled into a Web Application
                    Archive, or WAR file.
                    The single WAR can be uploaded to the server and
                    automatically deployed.

                    Declarative security can be used to protect requests for

                    .
                    This taglib is specifically designed to work well with
                    JSTL.
                    In particular, it uses the same "expression language"
                    engine for evaluating tag attribute values as JSTL.
                    This is in contrast to the original Struts tag library,
                    which can only use "rtexprvalue"s (runtime scriptlet
                    expressions) for dynamic attribute values.
                </p>

                <p>There are also toolkits available that make the framework
                    easy to use with
                    <a href="http://stxx.sourceforge.net/">XSLT</a>

                        JavaServer Faces technology.</a>
                    JSF simplifies building user interfaces for JavaServer
                    applications, both for the web and for the desktop.
                    For teams looking for a step-wise transition to JSF and Struts 1, we
                    offer Struts-Faces taglib,
                    which lets you use JSF components with your existing
                    Actions, so that you can migate to JSF one page a time.

            <subsection name="0.9 Extensible Markup Language (XML)" id="xml">

                <p>The features provided by the framework rely on a number of
                    objects that are
                    usually deployed using a configuration file written in
                    <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">Extensible Markup
                        Language.</a>
                    XML is also used to
                    configure Java web applications; so, this is yet another
                    familiar approach.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For more about how XML is used with Java applications
                    generally, see the
                    <a href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/jaxp/dist/1.1/docs/tutorial/index.html">
                        Java API for XML Processing</a> Tutorial.
                    While the framework makes good use of this API internally,
                    it is not something most developers would use
                    when writing their own applications with the framework.

            <subsection name="0.9.1 Descriptors" id="descriptors">

                <p>
                    When Java applications use XML configuration files,
                    the elements are most often used as
                    <em>descriptors.</em>
                    The application does not use the XML elements directly.
                    The elements are used to create and configure (or deploy)
                    Java objects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Java Servlet platform uses an XML configuration file
                    to deploy servlets (among other things).
                    Likewise, The framework uses an XML configuration file to
                    deploy objects.

                    While the framework can work with any approach to user
                    authentication and authorization, version 1.1 and later
                    offers
                    direct support for the standard Java Authentication and
                    Authorization Service (JAAS).
                    You can now specify security roles on an action-by-action
