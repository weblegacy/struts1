                    <strong>SPECIAL NOTE ON UPGRADING - README FIRST!</strong>
                    - If you use the standard
                    <strong>CANCEL BUTTON</strong>
                    in your application
                    and validate is set to true for that mapping, you
                    <strong>MUST</strong>
                    also specify "cancellable=true" in the mapping, otherwise,
                    an InvalidCancelException will be thrown if the Cancel button is
                    used. See the new
                    <a href="release-notes-1_3_1.html#opt-in">Opt-In Cancel Handling</a>
                    feature for more.

            <subsection name="Highlights of Changes" id="Highlight">
                <p>
                    The purpose of this section is to highlight the new
                    features since the
                    Version 1.3.1 release.
                    For more detail, see the Project Info reports for each
                    subproject,
                    which include a complete changelog and list of external
                    dependencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also access to the Apache Struts source repository and
                    change logs directly through both
                    <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/struts/action/trunk/?root=Apache-SVN">
                        web browser</a>

                    interfaces.
                </p>

                <h3>Struts</h3>

                <p>
                    Since Struts 1.3.1, we have moved the Struts 1 related
                    subprojects back into the Struts 1 project, leaving
                    Struts and Struts Shale the two remaining subprojects.
                    The Struts 1.3.2 release contains the following seven
                    components: Core, Applications, EL, Extras, Scripting,
                    Taglibs, and Tiles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Struts, including the website, is being
                    built with Maven 2.
                    But, of course, you can continue to build your own
                    projects any way you like!
                </p>
