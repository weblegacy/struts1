Convenient mechanisms to create new beans based on the value of request cookies, headers, and parameters are also provided.Many of the tags in this tag library will throw a JspException at runtime when they are utilized incorrectly (such as when you specify an invalid combination of tag attributes). JSP allows you to declare an "error page" in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%@ page %&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; directive. If you wish to process the actual exception that caused the problem, it is passed to the error page as a request attribute under key org.apache.struts.action.EXCEPTION.If you are viewing this page from within the Struts Documentation Application (or online at http://struts.apache.org), you can learn more about using these tags in the Bean Tags Developer's Guide.)</title>
